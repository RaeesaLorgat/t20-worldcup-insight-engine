# t20-worldcup-insight-engine
This project builds a live prediction and insight system for the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026.
It starts with a baseline match-winner model and evolves into advanced expected-runs/wickets analytics and post-tournament evaluation.

### Data Limitations

- Afghanistan men's matches are excluded from the Cricsheet dataset due to data usage policies.
- As a result, predictions involving Afghanistan may be less reliable or excluded from analysis.
- This limitation is acknowledged and does not materially affect overall tournament-level insights.
